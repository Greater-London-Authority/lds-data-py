# lds-data-py
Package of tools to interrogate London Datastore with Python

Vaguely inspired by https://github.com/Greater-London-Authority/ldndatar although won't be API-compatible for a while.

# Usage
Using pip:
```
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Greater-London-Authority/lds-data-py.git
```
